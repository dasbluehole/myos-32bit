Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/myos-32bit
This is a simple OS in C. just a C implementation of my Other OS project NanoOS(https://github.com/dasbluehole/nanoos)
If you need details please see that project. Both project have same capability and at same state.

I did not have time to push these 2 projects further hence I stopped time investment.
